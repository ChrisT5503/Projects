To whoever this may concern, 

This repository has three projects to which I believe reflect my knowledge and experience in Python and SQL.
Each project is different in its focus for coding methods, 
and the alcohol sales flask app project is the latest and best quality work that my team and I developed, as our professor rated our project as best in class.
I hope these projects reflect strongly on the skills I have developed in the programming field.
